# Assignment 2
## Cecelia Freese


  I have been trying to take Intro to Wed Design for
  the past three years. Every time I had an advising
  session I was asked about taking it. Every. Single. Time.
  My coding skills aren't very good and I think being able to build a website is a good tool to have moving forward.  

  I hope to learn how to:
  - create a professional website
  - maintain a website
  - code better
