Differences between divs, classes, ids, spans.

  A div is an element used to group things together and contains one id, one or more classes, and one span or more if necessary. An id is an attribute that acts as an identifier for the element and should be different for each. A class is another attribute and is used for styling. Spans are used for sectioning inside the div and are used to show text inside the div.

What is "alt text" and why do we use it?

  "Alt text" is text we include with a piece of media that acts as a description of that media. It is used for accessibility as well as being displayed if the content cannot be rendered. Including "alt text" is considered good form.
