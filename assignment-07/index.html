        <h2>Lyrics<h2>
          <pre>Jumping Jack till falling down
            Car wheels never touched the ground
            Arms and legs, their body good
            Till it falls apart like we're made of wood
            Like we're falling down
            Nothing ever happens when you ride the bus
            'Cause we're looking out the windows wondering what the fuss
            Hens and hubbies with their eyes closed like
            They got nothing to believe even one last night
            And you're praying real hard

            Hey now now pull the wool on, eh
            Hey now now pull the wool on, eh
            Hey now now pull the wool on
            Like a sweater up over your face
            Hey now now who you foolin', eh
            Hey now now who you foolin'
            I'm just playing a part, playing a part
            Playing playing playing a part

            Digital ambassador of wonder and cheer
            Everyone claiming it was quite a year
            Melting like the devil, blew the candle on the cake
            And dripping down the sides from another earthquake
            Keep praying real hard

            Hey now now pull the wool on, eh
            Hey now now pull the wool on, eh
            Hey now now pull the wool on
            Like a sweater up over your face
            Hey now now who you foolin', eh
            Hey now now who you foolin'
            I'm just playing a part, playing a part
            Playing playing playing a part

            Why you foolin' in your mind
            Drink up time, pay to be wise
            How we living
            How we fooling
            It's how we're living
            Why we're fooling

            Hey now now pull the wool on, eh
            Hey now now pull the wool on, eh
            Hey now now pull the wool on
            Like a sweater up over your face
            Hey now now who you foolin', eh
            Hey now now who you foolin'
            I'm just playing a part, playing a part
            Playing playing playing a part

            Have you ever
            Seen the things
            That you read about
            Have you ever
            Lived the life
            That you write about
            Nothing
            As it seems
            If you're just
            Foolin' around
            So pull the wool
            Up off your face
            Open those eyes

            Have you ever
            Dreamt beyond
            What you see right now
            Have you ever
            Found a way
            To live free and loud
            No, nothing
            As it seems
            If you're just
            Foolin' around
            So pull the wool
            Up off your face
            Open those eyes
