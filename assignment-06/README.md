Describe forms you have come across while browsing the web. What purpose do they serve?

One of the most common form for me are logins as text boxes. Used for security for anything from taxes to Pinterest. Another form would be buttons. Lots of websites have their logo image be a button that takes the user back to the home page.

List examples of a text, selection, and button input and where they might be used.

Text boxes are used for comment sections as well as fields for the user to type in their email and login information. Checkboxes and drop downs can be used for selection. With a checkbox, the user can select more than one option. Drop down boxes allow for one selection Buttons have a few types. Radio buttons are used to have the user pick one option from a list. The <button> tag can be used to turn an image into a button.

Summarize work cycle for assignment.

The work for this cycle went faster than the other sections. I started by taking detailed notes from the website. The assignment was done in one sitting after I had finished taking notes. Over all, very productive.
