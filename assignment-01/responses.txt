How is the web different than the internet?
  The internet is a large distributed network (of networks), similar to a mesh,  housing information that
  can be passed from one area to another very easily.
  The web is the system that connects and organizes information by topic, making it accessible and user friendly.

Briefly describe how the internet works.
  The internet is a wire connecting to a server that houses files. Two computers on the same wire can connect
  to each other. You connect your computer to the internet through an internet service provider and then into a
  server that houses the information you are looking for. If you are sending something across the internet, the
  information is broken into packets and sent through many different channels to the receiver where they are 
  reassembled.

What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?
  A directory is a folder used to house and organize files.

Why is using VCS beneficial?
  A version control system is useful for tracking changes made to your projects. With each modification to a project,
  GitHub forces you to "commit" changes, similar to saving a draft. The nice thing about this is that the user can go
  back and look at each version of the project that was "committed" and can revert back to an older version or just
  look at changes. Adding clear comments to each commit will help to describe what changes were made to the file,
  making it easier to find what you're looking for later.
