How many document <head> and <body> elements can a page have and how are these elements different, or what role do they play.

  Each document has one <head> and one <body> element. The head element is used for metadata that only the browser sees. The <body> element is used for all of the content on the page.

Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

  Structural markup is used to define how the web page will look. This includes elements like headings, paragraphs, and breaks. Semantic markup is used to create extra meaning in a document. This includes things like font choices such as bold, strong, or italics, and sub and superscript to create math elements like fractions.

Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  I spent a few hours looking through the website content and taking notes. This week I felt confident with how to write the code so I skipped watching the walkthrough. I noticed that the website mentions quizzes that I don't have access too so thats a little unnerving. For example, the website says that this week we have quiz 4, but I don't have a link for that on the Moodle page. I wrote all the code in one sitting.
