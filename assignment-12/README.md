# Assignment 12

Who was your imaginary client?

My imaginary client was a little flower shop called Best Blooms. They specialize in floral
varieties for all garden types. They needed a page for high quality images of their plants, a
catalog page for all their seed types, and an about page and contact page. I went with a simple
pink and white palette, taken from an image of petunias on their home page.


What is the difference between display: block, inline, and inline-block?

Block elements are stacked, with each new element on its own line. Inline elements are next to each other as long as they have enough space. Inline-block elements have properties from both inline and block elements and can have set widths and margins. 


Summarize work cycle.

I started with the navigation because I wanted to do something similar to the navigation in the last
assignment. Image hunting was next. After I had picked several images, I decided on a pink for the
navigation as well as the names of each section of it. I built the website in one session and wrote the
read.me last.
