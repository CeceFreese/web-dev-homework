# Final
## Cecelia Freese

Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

I was already familiar with GitHub from Creative Coding 1 but I have more respect for it now. Having every old version is really helpful, plus it's comforting to know that your project is saved in two places.


Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

Before this class I had no idea that there was a difference between web safe fonts and other fonts.
