Recap experience with HTML, what was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn.

HTML was difficult to begin with because I had to make the mental switch from Processing to it. I missed the easy commenting in my code that came with Processing but the TODO function in HTML is really nice. I really like the tag system and it was easy to understand.

Is there anything I'm anxious or exited to learn in next section (CSS)?

I'm excited to learn more about styling. HTML is decent but every website I have made with just it looks dated and a little clunky.

Summarize work cycle.

Take notes one day, knockout project over three.
