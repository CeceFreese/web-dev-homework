        <p> Coffee has become America's stimulant. With so many of us using
          caffeine to get through our everyday lives, it might be a good idea
          to learn how your daily latte is made.
        </p>
        <p>A latte is two ingredients; milk (or some variation of it) and
          espresso. To make a hot one, begin by pouring your milk of choice into
          a pitcher and steaming it with a steam wand. After the milk has been
          steamed, take a spoonful of the foam off of the top and put it into
          your cup. This is to preserve the flavor of the espresso shot with the
          protiens found in milk foam.

        <p>Side trip! Espresso is the essential ingredient in a good latte, but
          how can you tell it is any good? The two main characteristics of
          a good espresso shot are <b>caramel color</b> and a <b>semi-sweet aroma</b>.
          It is really easy for a good shot to turn into a bad one. If the espresso
          sits for too long before it is conbimed with the steamed milk, the shot will
          go bad.
        </p>

          <div id="table" class="table">
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row">Good Shot</th>
                <th scope="row">Dead Shot</th>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <th scope="col"><img src="./images/good_shots.jpg" width="50%"/></th>
                <th scope="col"><img src="./images/dead_shots.jpg" width="50%"/></th>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>

        <p> The bad shot has turned a blackish color where as the good shot is
          still caramel colored. If a shot sits too long, it will turn bad.
        </p>
        <p>For the next step, pull your shots of espresso. Make sure to pour
          them into your cup before their color turns black. The sooner the
          better.

        <p> Stir the espresso shots and milk foam. Pour in the rest of the
          steamed milk and the latte is finished.
