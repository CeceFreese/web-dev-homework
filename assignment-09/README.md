Difference between universal, element, class, and id selector types.
Universal selectors such as asterisks and "html" are used to set style guidelines for the entire page. Element selectors set the styles for built in elements such as paragraphs and headings. Class selectors only effect divs with that certain class tag. Id's are similar in that they only select divs with that unique id.

Discuss color palette, include hex codes.
My palette was built on a a light blue (#8be7fa) and light green (#c7f07c) color set that I used to create the gradient through an online generator. The font color is a darker green (#789f1d). To make the text box more readable, I went with a plain white background.

Summarize work cycle.
Take notes, build site. I knocked out the notes on one day and the site building on another. I really wanted to learn how to incorporate gradients, so I did a little internet digging.
